# Advent Of Code 2021

This is my personal Repository with my solutions for this years Advent of Code.   
For more information about the event visit [its homepage](https://adventofcode.com/).

### Disclaimer
As Advent Of Code publishes one challenge per day and you have limited time to solve it, if you want to get more points, 
the code in this repository does not aim for perfection but only for functionality.
If it works that is enough.

### Structure
The input files for each Day (`Day*.txt`) are in the resources folder. There is also always the test input as `Day*-test.txt`.

The Code is in the src folder with a class for each Day. The superclass `DAY` provides some input/output functionality for the other classes.
